""" MetaData is used to represent the metadata of an object in the Sync Service.
    Fields:
        object_id         is a unique identifier of the object.
	                      object_id and object_type must uniquely identify the object.
	                      Must be provided by the application
        object_type       is the type of the object.
	                      The type is used to group multiple objects, for example when checking for
                              object updates.
	                      Must be provided by the application
        dest_id           is the ID of the destination. If omitted the object is sent to all ESSs with
                              the same destination type.
	                      This field is ignored when working with ESS (the destination is the CSS).
        dest_type         is the type of destination to send the object to.
	                      If omitted (and if destinations_list is omitted too) the object is broadcasted
                              to all known destinations.
	                      This field is ignored when working with ESS (the destination is always the CSS).
        destinations_list is the list of destinations as type:id pairs to send the object to.
	                      When a DestinationsList is provided destination type and destination ID must be omitted.
	                      This field is ignored when working with ESS (the destination is always the CSS).
        expiration        is a timestamp/date indicating when the object expires.
	                      When the object expires it is automatically deleted.
	                      The timestamp should be provided in RFC3339 format.
	                      This field is available only when working with the CSS.
                          Optional field, if omitted the object doesn't expire.
        version           is the object's version (as used by the application).
	                      Optional field, empty by default.
        description       is a textual description of the object.
	                      Optional field, empty by default.
        link              is a link to where the data for this object can be fetched from.
	                      Optional field, if omitted the data must be provided by the application.
        inactive          is a flag indicating that this object is inactive for now.
	                      An object can be created as inactive which means it is not delivered to its
                              destination. The object can be activated later.
	                      Optional field, default is false (object active).
        activation_time   is a timestamp/date as to when this object should automatically be activated.
	                      The timestamp should be provided in RFC3339 format.
	                      Optional field, if omitted (and Inactive is true) the object is never automatically
                              activated.
        do_not_send       is a flag indicating that this object should not be sent to any destinations.
	                      Optional field, default is false (object is sent to destinations).
        no_data           is a flag indicating that there is no data for this object.
	                      Objects with no data can be used, for example, to send notifications.
	                      Optional field, default is false (object includes data).
        meta_only         MetaOnly is a flag that indicates that this update is only of the metadata. The
                              current object's data is left unchanged.
	                      Optional field, default is false (both data and metadata are updated).
        expected_consumers is the number of applications that are expected to indicate that they have consumed
                              the object.
	                      Optional field, default is 1.
	                      This field is used only when working with the CSS. The default value is always used
                              on the ESS.
        destination_data_uri  is a URI indicating where the receiver of the object should store it.
                          Currently only file URIs are supported.
	                      This field is available only when working with the CSS.
	                      Optional field, if omitted the object is stored in the node's internal storage.
        source_data_uri   is a URI indicating where the sender of the object should read the data from.
	                      Currently only file URIs are supported.
	                      This field is available only when working with the ESS.
	                      Optional field, if omitted the object's data should be provided by the user.
        auto_delete       is a flag indicating whether to delete the object after it is delivered to all its
                              destinations from the destinations list.
	                      Optional field, default is false (do not delete).
	                      This field is used only when working with the CSS. Objects are always deleted after
                              delivery on the ESS.
        deleted           is a flag indicating to applications polling for updates that this object has been
                              deleted.
	                      Read only field, should not be set by users.
        origin_id         is the ID of origin of the object. Set by the internal code.
	                      Read only field, should not be set by users.
        origin_type       is the type of origin of the object. Set by the internal code.
	                      Read only field, should not be set by users.
        instance_id       is an internal identifier of the object. Set by the internal code.
	                      Read only field, should not be set by users.
